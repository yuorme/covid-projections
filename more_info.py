                        Covid Projections Tracker is a tool that allows experts to easily track **projection accuracy** as well as **changes in projections over time**. 
                        Projectons may change as new data is incorporated or when model parameters or frameworks are updated. 
                        
                        COVID-19 is novel disease and there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty in all projections. 
                        Confidence intervals are available (selectable via the Metric dropdown) but are not overlayed for the sake of creating a cleaner visualization.
